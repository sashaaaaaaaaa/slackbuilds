loudgain is a versatile ReplayGain 2.0 loudness normalizer, based
the EBU R128/ITU BS.1770 standard (-18 LUFS) and supports FLAC/Ogg/
/MP3/MP4/M4A/ALAC/Opus/ASF/WMA/WAV/WavPack/AIFF/APE audio files.
It uses the well-known mp3gain commandline syntax but will never
modify the actual audio data.

rgbpm is an included bash script to invoke loudgain (and a BPM scanner)
and have it scan album folders, starting from a top folder, recursively.

NOTE: The version of taglib (which loudgain uses) included in Slackware
has a bug that possibly corrupts Ogg Vorbis files. Installing v1.12-beta-1
or the newest development version is recommended, found here:
