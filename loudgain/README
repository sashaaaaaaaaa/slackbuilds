loudgain is a versatile ReplayGain 2.0 loudness normalizer, based
the EBU R128/ITU BS.1770 standard (-18 LUFS) and supports FLAC/Ogg/
/MP3/MP4/M4A/ALAC/Opus/ASF/WMA/WAV/WavPack/AIFF/APE audio files.
It uses the well-known mp3gain commandline syntax but will never
modify the actual audio data.

rgbpm is an included bash script to invoke loudgain (and a BPM scanner)
and have it scan album folders, starting from a top folder, recursively.

NOTE: Stable releases of taglib (which loudgain uses) have an issue 
about possibly corrupting Ogg Vorbis files upon writing them. 
Temporarily a provided 64-bit binary 'loudgain.static' can be used to 
safely tag Ogg Vorbis files. 

On a 64-bit system by default both loudgain and loudgain.static are
included, but loudgain.static can be optionally left out by setting 
the following:

BOTH=no

You can choose to install the loudgain.static version only and link it 
to 'loudgain' with this option:

STATIC=yes

Note that the loudgain.static binary starts much slower.

Alternatively you can install taglib-1-12-beta-1 (This repository has a
slackbuild for that too) or the latest development version from 
https://github.com/taglib/taglib

NOTE 2: For Slackware-current you should comment out line 85
